What's New

  Bug Fixes

   The following bugs have been fixed:

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 1.8:
     * Wireshark on 32- and 64-bit Windows supports automatic updates.
     * The packet bytes view is faster.
     * You can now display a list of resolved host names in "hosts" format
       within Wireshark.
     * The wireless toolbar has been updated.
     * Wireshark on Linux does a better job of detecting interface
       addition and removal.
     * It is now possible to compare two fields in a display filter (for
       example: udp.srcport != udp.dstport). The two fields must be of the
       same type for this to work.
     * The Windows installers ship with WinPcap 4.1.3, which supports
       Windows 8.
     * USB type and product name support has been improved.
     * Wireshark now calculates HTTP response times and presents the
       result in a new field in the HTTP response. Links from the
       request's frame to the response's frame and vice-versa are also
       added.
     * The main welcome screen and status bar now display file sizes using
       strict SI prefixes instead of old-style binary prefixes.
     * Capinfos now prints human-readable statistics with SI suffixes by
       default.
     * It is now possible to open a referenced packet (such as the matched
       request or response packet) in a new window.
     * It is now possible for tshark to display only the hex/ascii packet
       data without also requiring that the packet summary and/or packet
       details are also displayed. If you want the old behavior, use -Px
       instead of just -x.
     * The Wireshark application icon, capture toolbar icons, and other
       icons have been updated.

   vary from platform to platform. You can use About->Folders to find the
   default locations on your system.
