== What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is the world's most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

== What's New

=== Bug Fixes

The following bugs have been fixed:

//* ws-buglink:5000[]
//* ws-buglink:6000[Wireshark bug]
//* cve-idlink:2013-2486[]
//* Wireshark always manages to score tickets for Burning Man, Coachella, and SXSW while you end up working double shifts. ws-buglink:0000[]

=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 1.10:

* Expert info is now filterable (if the dissector has been updated to support
  the new API).
* The Windows installer now uninstalls the previous version of Wireshark
  silently.  You can still run the uninstaller manually beforehand if you wish
  to run it interactively.
* The "Number" column shows related packets and protocol conversation spans
  (Qt only).
* When manipulating packets with editcap using the -C <choplen> and/or
  -s <snaplen> options, it is now possible to also adjust the original frame
  length using the -L option.
* You can now pass the -C <choplen> option to editcap multiple times, which
  allows you to chop bytes from the beginning of a packet as well as at the end
  of a packet in a single step.

== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You can
usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found
on the http://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations vary
from platform to platform. You can use Aboutâ†’Folders to find the default
locations on your system.
